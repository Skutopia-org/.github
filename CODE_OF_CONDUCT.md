## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences. We should look to understand other viewpoints as a learning experience, rather than a chance to criticise.  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Accepting responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community  
* Focussing on data and factual based justifications removing emotion and emotive language

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission  
* Spam or other deceptive practices that take advantage of the community  
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
